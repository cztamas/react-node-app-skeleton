# react-node-app-skeleton

A minimalist skeleton repo to make starting new projects easier. Work in progress.

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Start dev server
```
npm start
```
Compiles client with hot reloading and starts server with automatic restart on code change.

### Run tests (and linter)
```
npm t
```
